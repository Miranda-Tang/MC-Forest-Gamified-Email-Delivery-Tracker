# MailChannels Forest: Gamified Email Delivery Tracker

## 📚 Description

The `MailChannels Forest` project is a dynamic web application enabling users to visualize the volume of
successful `email deliveries` to each MailChannels customer. The core concept turns traditional statistics into a
vibrant, interactive forest, where each tree represents a client, and the color of the tree illustrates the number of
emails delivered - **the redder the tree, the more emails have been delivered.**

## 📝 Features

- **Interactive Client Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard lists all clients with their corresponding email counts.
  Users can sort this list in descending or ascending order based on their preference.
- **Dynamic Search Functionality:** Incorporating a flexible search option, users can swiftly look for specific clients
  using keywords. The search supports regular expression matching for broader look-ups. Moreover, users can sort the
  search results and reset the search when needed.
- **Engaging 2D Visualization:** Each client is represented with a 2D tree in the forest. The color of the tree
  signifies the volume of successful email deliveries - transitioning from green to red as the number increases.

## 🔭 Technical Skills

Developed with `MongoDB`, `Express.js`, and `Node.js`, and incorporated `EJS` for templating, the application provides a
user-friendly way for employees to keep track of their clients' activities. The application employs `Passport` for user
authentication and `bcrypt` for password security.
